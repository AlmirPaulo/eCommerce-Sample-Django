# eCommerce-Sample-Django

*A Project by [Almir Paulo](https://almirpaulo.github.io/)*

An eCommerce website sample built in Python with Django. 

A have started a similar project in Flask, but I have decided to restart the ideia with this one. 

The idea behind this project is to figure out on my portfolio to show my backend skills. Of course, you can use this in order to study Django, Python, Backend, etc.
