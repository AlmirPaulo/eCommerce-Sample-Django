# eCommerce-Sample-Django

*A Project by [Almir Paulo](https://almirpaulo.github.io/)*

An eCommerce website sample built in Python with Django. 

A have started a similar project in Flask, but I have decided to restart the ideia with Django once this a most used framework in projects like this. 

The idea behind this project is to figure out on my portfolio to show my skills. Of course, you can use this in order to study Django, Python, etc.
